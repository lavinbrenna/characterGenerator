            <h2>Rockerboy</h2>
            <p>Rebel rockers who use music and revolt to fight authority</p>
            <p>
              Rockerboys are the medieval bards of the dark future, the rebels,
              the punks and the musicians who use their voice to inspire the
              masses. Rockerboys are there to spread the anti-corporate message,
              to inform the downtrodden and weak and to lead groups into battle.
              The most famous Rockerboy to ever live is Johnny Silverhand; a
              soldier gone AWOL, he leads the band Samurai all the while
              plotting against the evil Arasaka corporation.

            <p>Hired assassins, bodyguards, killers, soldiers</p>
            <p>
              Typically ex-military, almost certainly cyber-enhanced with more
              weaponry than a small army and ready to blow you away if somebody
              was paying. The Solo is your typical gun for hire character class,
              who thinks first, asks questions later and collects a paycheck for
              it. Morgan Blackhand, described as the Solo's Solo, is the most
              famous of these mercenaries.

            <p>Cybernetic computer hackers</p>
            <p>
              Fanatics of the workings of the Net. Rather than living in
              realspace where their abilities are limited by reality, Netrunners
              prefer to experience life through the means offered within the
              Net's artificial universe. With unique access to the Menu, they
              find themselves naturally savvy in sapping company networks and
              breaking into high-priority security systems for both a living and
              entertainment. These network trespasses are necessary to steal
              funds and information from networks. The data that is stolen is
              generally sold to a third party buyer, however this data does not
              come free, as the Netrunner must undergo the ultimate challenge of
              man versus machine in bypassing counter-intrusion programs that
              guard the techno-fortresses of the Net.

            <p>Renegade mechanics and doctors</p>
            <p>
              Techies typically have the highest tech stat of the group and play
              an important role making tech work for them.If you're any good,
              you're making a lot of money. And that money goes into new
              gadgets, hardware and information. You'll buy almost any new
              thing- because it might have a dozen side applications you can
              use. Of course, your black market work isn't just making you
              friends-it's also racking you up an impressive number of enemies
              as well; people who've run into your handiwork and resented it. So
              you'll invest a lot in defense systems and, if really pushed to
              the wall, call in a few markers on a Solo or two.

              They're bending the truth out there. And you're going to stop
              them. Someone has to do it. The Corporations rule the world. They
              dump toxins, destabilize economies and commit murder with equal
              impunity. The Government won't stop them-they own the Government.
              The only thing between the Corporations and world domination is
              the Media. And that's you.

          <div id="randcop">
            <h2>Cop</h2>
            <p>Maximum lawmen on mean 21st century streets</p>
            <p>
              In the old days, they only used to shoot at cops. Now you're lucky
              if you just take a slug. The Street is mean these days, filled
              with new drugs, new gangs, and new weapons that make an M-16 look
              like a kid's toy. If you're on a City Force, you know how bad it
              is. You're carrying at least four high caliber weapons, most of
              them full-auto types, wearing a Kevlar vest that'll stop 850
              ft/lbs per square inch- and you're still outgunned and outflanked.
              Half the gangs are cyber: super speed, super reflexes, enhanced
              night-vision, weapons in their arms ... The other half are
              freelance Corporate meres - gangs hired by the Corps to enforce
              their policies on the street. And there you are - a beat cop or
              detective in an armored squad-car, patrolling this jungle with the
              heavy predators.

          <div id="randcorpo">
            <h2>Corpo</h2>
            <p>Slick business raiders and multi-millionaires</p>
            <p>
              In the old days, they would have called you a yuppie - a hard
              driven, fast-track MBA on his way up the Corporate ladder. Sure,
              it's selling your soul to the Company, but face it; the
              Corporations rule the Cyberpunk world. They control governments,
              markets, nations, armies - you name it. And you know that whoever
              controls the Corporations controls everything else.Right now, your
              life as a junior executive is anything but easy. There are guys
              underneath you who'd kill for a shot at your job. There are guys
              over you who'd kill to keep you out of their jobs. And they're not
              kidding about the killing - every up and comer in the Corporation
              has his own crew of Solos and Netrunners to cover his pet
              projects. Sabotage? Constantly. Bribery? Routine. Blackmail?
              Common. Promotion by assassination? Always a possibility. The
              stakes are that high - one slip and you could be out on the Street
              with the rest of the trash, or dead.

            <h2>Fixer</h2>
            <p>Deal makers, smugglers, organizers and information brokers</p>
            <p>
              You realized fast that you weren't ever going to get into a
              Corporate job. And you didn't think you were tough enough or crazy
              enough to be a Solo either. But as a small time punk, you knew you
              had a knack for figuring out what other people wanted, and how to
              get it for them. For a price, of course.Now your deals have moved
              past the nickle and-dime stuff into the big time. Maybe you move
              illegal weapons over the border. Or steal and resell medical
              supplies from the Corporations. Perhaps you're a skill broker
              acting as an agent for high priced Solos and 'Runners, or even
              hiring a whole Nomad pack to back a client's contracts. You buy
              and sell favors like an old-style Mafia godfather. You have
              connections into all kinds of businesses, deals and political
              groups. You don't do this directly, of course-no, you use your
              contacts and allies as part of a vast web of intrigue and
              coercion. If there's a hot nightclub in the City, you've bought
              into it. If there are new military-class weapons on the Street,
              you smuggled 'em in. If there's a Corporate war going down, you're
              negotiating between sides with an eye on the main chance.

            <h2>Nomad</h2>
            <p>Road warriors and gypsies who roam the highways</p>
            <p>
              They drove your family off the Farm ten years ago. The
              Corporations rolled in, took over the land, and put rent-a cops
              all over the place. It wasn't the first time it'd happened; it
              wouldn't be the last. Gradually, your family fell in with a bunch
              of other homeless families, and they met another group ... until
              you'd created a Nomad pack of nearly two hundred members.Now,
              crammed into a huge, ragtag fleet of cars, vans, buses and RV's,
              your Nomad pack roams the freeways. You look for supplies, odd
              jobs and spare parts in a world where society has fragmented. The
              pack is your home-it has teachers, Med Techs, leaders, and
              mechanics it's virtually a town on wheels in which everyone is
              related by marriage or kinship. Sometimes the Pack pulls into a
              town just to fuel up or get grub. Other times, it swings south to
              follow the harvest; you pick crops in trade for cash or food. Less
              law abiding Packs are like mobile armies, terrorizing cities and
              hiring out as muscle in Corporate wars. For obvious reasons, the
              cops don't like Nomads. But it doesn't matter-your vehicles are
              usually well armored and bristling with stolen weapons; mini guns,
              rocket launchers and the like. Every kid knows how to use a rifle,
              and everyone packs a knife. Being homeless in the 2000's isn't
              easy.
